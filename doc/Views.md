Change tools, like induction zones.

A tool has properties that defines the time it takes to do something, like boil water. Which tool that is used will
define how much time it will take to e.g boil water.

A tool can have multiple properties that adjusts the time it takes to do something. For an induction zone, at 3500 watt,
defines that it spends 2 minutes to boil 1 water of water from 8C. Another induction zone could spend e.g 4 minutes on
the same task.
