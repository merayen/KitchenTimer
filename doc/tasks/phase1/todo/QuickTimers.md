# Quick timers
When not following a recipe in the app, or just needing one or more timers, it should be easy for the user to
quickly create and start timers. Those timers should probably be discarded when time runs out and acknowledged by the
user.

## Implementation
Add a "Quick Timers" button on the right in the Running Timers list. Clicking it should show the "Quick Timers" view in
the main activity.
